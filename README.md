# RGP_iitkgp_facies_classification_using_single_stacked_ensemble_models
This repository contains code for building ML-based single and ensemble classifiers to predict coal, carbonaceous shale, and non-coal facies from high-resolution well logs. While single models struggle with carbonaceous facies, heterogeneous and stacked ensembles show strong overall and class-wise improvements.
