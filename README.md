# RGP_iitkgp_facies_classification_using_single_stacked_ensemble_models
This repository contains code for building ML-based single and ensemble classifiers to predict coal, carbonaceous shale, and non-coal facies from high-resolution well logs. While single models struggle with carbonaceous facies, heterogeneous and stacked ensembles show strong overall and class-wise improvements.
Overview

This repository contains the complete machine-learning workflow for developing single and ensemble classifiers to predict coal, carbonaceous shale, and non-coal lithofacies from high-resolution well-log data.
Although single classifiers show limited skill in distinguishing carbonaceous facies, ensemble approaches—particularly stacked, heterogeneous, and selected homogeneous ensembles—demonstrate substantial improvements in both class-wise and overall performance.

Note: All source well-log files are confidential and therefore omitted.
Paths are replaced with "___" placeholders, which users must update to run the notebook.
